We broke down the code line by line and took deep dives not only into the syntax, but also the concepts and foundation of the back-end.

Following that, turned my attention back to the course and continued working with Node and Express. Built some demo web apps in order to gain some familiarity with the syntax. Towards the end of the day, had a server (again through Node) running a dynamic site with multiple pages.</p>

					Busy week, outside of coding. Lots of construction at the house resulting in inability to maintain a consistent 
					schedule for coding. However, a <em>minimum</em> of 45 minutes was devoted to coding daily. Primarily, work consisted of developing
					full-stack applications using NodeJS and Express. The result is a social app similar to Yelp -- called YelpCamp.
					<hr>
					<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
					YelpCamp is a web application with a directory of campgrounds. The idea is a type of application
					which renders campgrounds for users to view and review. The stack being used is HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, and ExpressJS. Currently, it's an application
					being built using a web development course. Though, the site isn't completely congruent with that of the one presented in the class syllabus. 
					Although I am still utilizing the same stack, and bootstrap version as the course, I am allowing myself some creative freedom
					whilst I build the course page (primarly in order to grasp the tools being used). Following the completion of YelpCamp,
					my goal is to build a social network using a similar stack, and possibly a similar concept. However, I do have in mind an affinity towards a blog or network
					for intellectual discourse -- containing predominantly computer and cognitive sciences.

						Latter part of week 2. First week of school, first week of new job, and first week with my new workspace.
						<p>Beautiful screen, great specs. Loads of fun getting work done here. I'm actually excited to take on a strenous workload and structure my day in order to make the most out of my time.</p>
						<p><i>Anyway,</i> over the past few days I have been working on a website which will display my work. It will be a simple, responsive, and modern site displaying information about me, work i've done, and 
						contact information --- preferably a form users can directly fill for an immediate quote.</p>
						<p>I find myself constantly taking on multiple projects at one time and I feel it hinders my ability to fully complete one.<hr><strong>I am hereby proclaiming that I will not start another project until
							this one (The Portfolio) is complete.</strong>
						<p>I'm not exactly sure if working on one project at a time is the most efficacious way to learn more, but I guess I'll attempt this way, since I am always focusing on many at once.
							This is mostly just a brainless rant at 1.48AM on a Saturday morning. But work has been done with which I am pleased.</p>
							<p>Now, instead of rambling brainlessly some more, I will go look into to something, get some sleep, and get back to it in the morning -- 9AM sharp.</p>
